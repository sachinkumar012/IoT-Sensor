1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
The HVAC system consists of:
- 2 main air handling units (AHU-1 and AHU-2)
- 4 rooftop units (RTU-1 through RTU-4)
- Variable air volume (VAV) boxes throughout the building
- Energy recovery ventilators (ERV-1 and ERV-2)
- Chilled water system with 2 chillers
- Hot water system with 2 boilers

2. PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE

DAILY CHECKS:
- Monitor system performance via BMS
- Check for unusual noises or vibrations
- Verify temperature and humidity readings
- Check filter pressure differentials

WEEKLY CHECKS:
- Inspect air filters for cleanliness
- Check belt tension on motors
- Verify damper positions
- Clean condensate drain pans

MONTHLY CHECKS:
- Lubricate motor bearings
- Check refrigerant levels
- Inspect electrical connections
- Calibrate temperature sensors

QUARTERLY CHECKS:
- Clean evaporator and condenser coils
- Replace air filters
- Check and adjust belt tension
- Inspect ductwork for leaks

ANNUAL CHECKS:
- Comprehensive system inspection
- Calibrate all sensors and controls
- Test emergency systems
- Performance testing and optimization

3. TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

HIGH ENERGY CONSUMPTION:
Symptoms: Unusually high utility bills, system running continuously
Causes: Dirty filters, refrigerant leaks, improper setpoints
Solutions: Replace filters, repair leaks, optimize setpoints

POOR AIR QUALITY:
Symptoms: Complaints about stuffy air, odors, dust
Causes: Dirty filters, poor ventilation, contaminated ducts
Solutions: Replace filters, increase ventilation, clean ducts

UNEVEN TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION:
Symptoms: Hot and cold spots throughout building
Causes: Damper malfunctions, duct leaks, improper balancing
Solutions: Repair dampers, seal duct leaks, rebalance system

SYSTEM NOISE:
Symptoms: Unusual sounds from equipment
Causes: Loose belts, worn bearings, unbalanced fans
Solutions: Tighten belts, replace bearings, balance fans

4. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

SYSTEM FAILURE:
1. Check emergency power status
2. Verify critical loads are served
3. Contact maintenance team immediately
4. Implement manual override if necessary
5. Document incident for analysis

FIRE ALARM INTEGRATION:
1. HVAC system automatically shuts down
2. Smoke dampers close automatically
3. Emergency ventilation activates
4. System remains off until alarm clears
5. Manual restart required after clearance
